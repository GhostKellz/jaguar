So, is v0.2.0 ready?
Short answer: No, but we have a solid foundation.

What we have (could be v0.1.0):

✅ Complete GPU rendering system (Software, OpenGL, WebGL)
✅ Wayland-first windowing with cross-platform support
✅ Event system
✅ Basic examples working
What v0.2.0 still needs:

<input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Advanced widget library (the bulk of the work)
<input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Text rendering system
<input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Layout engine (Flex, Grid, etc.)
<input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Styling and theming
<input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Memory optimization
<input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Performance profiling
<input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Developer tooling
Recommendation:

Tag current state as v0.1.0 - "Foundation Release"
Use v0.2.0 for the full widget system - This aligns better with the ambitious goals listed
The current state is excellent foundational work - we have everything needed to start building the widget system. But v0.2.0 as described in the TODO.md is a much larger scope that includes professional-grade widgets, advanced tooling, and production features.

Would you like me to:

Restructure the TODO.md to reflect v0.1.0 (current) vs v0.2.0 (future)?
Start working on the next major piece (widget system)?
Create a release tag for the current foundation?
